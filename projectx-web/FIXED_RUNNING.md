**URL:** http://localhost:3001 (Port 3000 was in use)

## 🎉 What Was Fixed

### Issue
```
Next.js is outdated - dependency conflicts with:
- React 19 incompatibility
- tailwindcss-animate module not found
- @radix-ui/react-slot version conflicts
- @types/fuse.js not in registry
```

### Solution
```
✅ Updated Next.js to 15.5.6 (latest stable)
✅ Kept React 18.3.1 (compatible & stable)
✅ Removed troublesome dependencies:
   - tailwindcss-animate (optional, not needed)
   - @radix-ui/react-slot (unused)
   - class-variance-authority (unused)
   - @types/fuse.js (not available)
✅ Used --legacy-peer-deps for clean install
✅ Clean node_modules reinstall
```

### Result
```
✅ npm install successful (506 packages)
✅ Dev server running on http://localhost:3001
✅ No compilation errors
✅ All pages load without errors
```

## 🚀 Now You Can

### 1. View Your Project
Open browser: **http://localhost:3001**

### 2. Test the /kits Page
- Visit: http://localhost:3001/kits
- Try filters: age, level, domain, price
- Try search: type "robot" or "sensory"
- Should work perfectly!

### 3. Check What's Available
- ✅ Home page (/): Loads
- ✅ Kits catalog (/kits): Fully functional with filters
- ✅ Sample data: 8 kits, 12 lessons loaded
- ✅ Search: Works with fuzzy matching
- ✅ Responsive design: Try on mobile

### 4. Start Building
Now that the server is running, you can:

**Option A: Keep dev server running**
```bash
# It's already running on http://localhost:3001
# Make changes to files and see them auto-reload
```

**Option B: Open another terminal**
```bash
cd /Users/abhshek/Myaiproject/projectx-web
# Now you can edit files while server runs
```

## 📂 Project Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Dev Server** | ✅ Running | Port 3001 |
| **/kits Page** | ✅ Working | Filters + search |
| **Components** | ✅ Ready | Badge, KitCard |
| **Data** | ✅ Loaded | 8 kits, 12 lessons |

## ⚠️ Notes

### Port 3001 Instead of 3000
- Port 3000 is in use by another process
- Next.js automatically switched to 3001
- This is normal and works fine
- **Use:** http://localhost:3001

### Workspace Warning
- VS Code shows: "multiple lockfiles detected"
- This is harmless - just informational
- The app works perfectly fine
